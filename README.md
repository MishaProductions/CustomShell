# Custom shell
An attempt of making UWP apps work using a custom shell.

# Note
The customShell exe will not work without the driver. The driver patches a few methods in the window manager that allows this to work without being signed by microsoft. Use OSR driver loader to start the driver.

# TODO
 - Fix crash when resizing settings app
